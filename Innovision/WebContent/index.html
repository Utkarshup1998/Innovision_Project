  	<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>After observing the problems faced by people of all categories i.e.,students faced problems in
their concentration,electricians wasted a lot of time in taking multiple reading etc. We wanted a
device which could solve all these problems and moreover be economically feasible so that any
person in need of this device could easily afford it .GOOGLE GLASS is alfeady in market but it is
not affordable by everyone.
So ,we started researching upon the methods and ways we could take so that the required
device can be prepared in low cost which would be economical and feasible by every person.We
took help of our teachers,seniors and various web sites ,and ended in finding many efficient
ways.

People using large electronics waste a lot of time in watching the readings ,docters often loose
concentration while taking various readings,students working on projects wasted time in seeing
mobile notifications and many more.So we wanted to make a device which could solve all
these problems and we resulted in making our device INNOVISION:Visualiozing the digital
world.Smarter than smart watch,with more specifications,more convenient,less
economical.This device can be used in any climatic conditions ,capable of satnding with us in
rain ,storm,day ,night without any loss in its efficiency.</p>
